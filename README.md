Introductory assignment to showcase my current knowledge.

This github consists of a simple html webpage, displaying a list of 10 different companies and their specialties. The webpage has a simple filter functionality, which let you filter companies on their tags (for example Frontend).

## How to run
- Go to the **updates** branch and download the zip file.

- The page can be run launching any local host in the directory. I used an extention on VSCode called Live Server to run a local host. ![alt text](./images/live-server.png "Live Server Extention") 

- Alternatively, if you have python installed on your device, you can open the directory in cmd and run: `py -m http.server` (`python` instead of `py` depending on version). This command will launch the webpage on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
